# Shooting Stars
A simple game made in MATLAB, where you have to click on stars to gain points.

## How to play
1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where the game is stored (Most likely `Shooting Stars`).
2. Add `lib` and `src` folders to path.
3. Run `main.m` file by typing `main` in the command window.

## Scoring
Score depends on the following factors:
- Combo - Number of consecutive "Hits"
- Size of star compared to average
- Angular velocity of star (How fast it is spinning)

Neither the velocity of the star nor its Color phase affects its score.
