# Shooting Stars
A simple game made in MATLAB, where you have to click on stars to gain points.

Made as mini-project for Comp2b

## TODO
- Keep doing updates without pausing, then using the time elapsed between updates to calculate frame rate
- Integrate Render and Update functions together
- Use plothandles to improve performance
- Add a custom linV attribute for stars
